v1.8.0
------
* Overall: Support level is now 3.5.5 (last before 4.0.0)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Switch the base URL to None, throw an error when no base url is passed. Having mastosoc as default was sensible when there were only three mastodon servers. It is not sensible now and trips people up constantly.
* GENERAL WARNING: Currently, Mastodon.py does not support the "new" filter system. In the future, it will, and it will respect filters by default (i.e. remove filtered posts).
* Fixed an issue with the fix for the Pleroma date bug (thanks adbenitez)
* Added trending APIs (`trending_tags`, `trending_statuses`, `trending_links`, `admin_trending_tags`, `admin_trending_statuses`, `admin_trending_links`)
* Added `lang` parameter and document what it does properly.
* Added `category` and `rule_ids` to `reports`
* Made the documentation a bit neater (thanks dieseltravis)
* Added the domain blocking admin API (`admin_domain_blocks`, `admin_domain_block`, `admin_update_domain_block`, `admin_delete_domain_block` - thanks catgoat)
* Added the stats admin APIs (`admin_measures`, `admin_dimensions`, `admin_retention`)
* Added client auth data to access token file.
* Added `account_familiar_followers` API
* Added `account_remove_from_followers` API
* Added `admin_accounts_v2` API
* FUTURE BREAKING CHANGE WARNING: For now, `admin_accounts` still calls v1, but this may change in the future. You are encouraged to use v2 instead.
* Made the version comparisons a bit nicer (thanks eumiro)
* Switch to more recent modules for datetime and timezone stuff (thanks eumiro)
* Made the documentation a bit more consistent (thanks dieseltravis)
* Substantially restructured the documentation, making it a lot nicer to read
* Substantially restructured the code, making it hopefully a lot easier to maintain
    * This SHOULD NOT break anything. If this breaks your code, please let me know.
* This too isn't really a changelog entry but in the same vein as the last post, thank you Claire and Gargron for clarifying many things about the API when asked.

v1.7.0
------
* Cleaned code up a bit (thanks eumiro)
* Fixed some Pleroma related issues (thanks aveao, taraletti, adbenitez)

* Added support for using pathlib paths when loading media files (Thanks reagle)
* Removed blocklist with long dead instances
* Added `types` parameter to notifications.
* Documented additional notification types
* Made version parsing more robust against varions things that Mastodon-compatible APIs might throw at it.
* TECHNICALLY BREAKING CHANGE, but I would be quite surprised if this actually breaks anyone: Date parsing will now, when the date string is empty, return Jan. 1st, 1970 instead. This is to work around what I assume is a bug in Pleroma.

v1.6.3
------
* Add server rules API (`instance_rules`)
* Add confirmation email resend API (`email_resend_confirmation`)
* Add account lookup API (`account_lookup`)
