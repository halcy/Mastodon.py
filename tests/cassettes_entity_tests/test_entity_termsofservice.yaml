        information do we collect?</h1>\n\n<p>We collect information from you when
        you register on our site and gather data when you participate in the forum
        by reading, writing, and evaluating the content shared here.</p>\n\n<p>When
        registering on our site, you may be asked to enter your name and e-mail address.
        You may, however, visit our site without registering. Your e-mail address
        will be verified by an email containing a unique link. If that link is visited,
        we know that you control the e-mail address.</p>\n\n<p>When registered and
        posting, we record the IP address that the post originated from. We also may
        retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server
        and diagnostic information for errors.\nWhat do we use your information for?</p>\n\n<p>Any
        of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following
        ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To function as a social media website - we display
        and share the posts that you make, associated with a pseudonym of your choosing.
        We do not require you to provide your legal name to use this website.</li>\n<li>To
        personalize your experience - your information helps us to better respond
        to your individual needs.</li>\n<li>To improve service - your information
        helps us to more effectively respond to your support needs and to fix operational
        problems.</li>\n<li>To send periodic emails - The email address you provide
        may be used to send you information, notifications that you request about
        changes to topics or in response to your user name, respond to inquiries,
        and/or other requests or questions. You can opt out of automatic e-mails by
        indicating that you do not with to receive notification e-mails in the website
        settings.</li>\n<li>To prevent abuse - your information helps us to moderate
        the content on this website and to prevent use of the website that contravenes
        our rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>How do we protect your information?</h1>\n\n<p>We
        implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal
        information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Communication
        is encrypted using modern cryptographic standards (Using SSL with a certificate
        signed by LetsEncrypt). Full access to data is restricted to people who unavoidably
        require such access to perform maintenance operations, such as the administrator
        (located in Estonia).</p>\n\n<p>All data we collect is stored on a dedicated
        server in Germany, operated by Hetzner Online GmbH. A daily backup copy of
        all data excluding log files is stored on a computer operated by the web site
        administrator on private premises in Estonia. A continuous streaming backup
        is additonally stored on a second server operated by Hetzner Online GmbH,
        located in Finland.</p>\n\n<h1>What is your data retention policy?</h1>\n\n<p>We
        will make a good faith effort to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Retain server logs containing
        the IP address of all requests to this server no more than 30 days.</li>\n<li>Retain
        the IP addresses associated with registered users and their posts no more
        than 5 years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Data portability</h1>\n\n<p>You can export
        most of the data we collect about you using site features. You can contact
        us via e-mail to get exports of your data beyond that.</p>\n\n<h1>Do we use
        cookies?</h1>\n\n<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service
        provider transfers to your computer&#39;s hard drive through your Web browser
        (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and,
        if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.
        We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and
        compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we
        can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>\n\n<h1>Do we
        disclose any information to outside parties?</h1>\n\n<p>We do not sell, trade,
        or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.
        This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our
        site, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
        We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate
        to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others
        rights, property, or safety. Non-personally identifiable visitor and aggregate
        information may be provided to other parties to help improve the website.</p>\n\n<p>We
        do transfer some of your data, such as posts you make and the pseudonym with
        which you have registered on this website, to other servers in the ActivityPub
        and OStatus networks. We also store and display such data that we receive
        from other servers on the network. We do this because it is neccesary to do
        it for this website to provide the services of a distributed social network.
        You can opt out of this by only allowing people from your local server to
        follow you. If you use web notifications, we share your data (in an encrypted
        form) with your web notification provider. You can opt out of this by not
        using web notifications.</p>\n\n<p>This website is hosted on a server located
        in a Hetzner datacenter in Germany. While we do not explicitly share any information
        with them and they do not regularly process any of your data, they may as
        part of maintenance operations or to comply with the law gain access to that
        data. You can review their privacy policy on the Hetzner website.\nThird party
        links</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, we or our users may include or offer third party
        products or services on our site. These third party sites have separate and
        independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability
        for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek
        to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these
        sites.\nAge restrictions</p>\n\n<p>Our site and services are all directed
        to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under 16, you must get
        parental consent to be allowed to use this website. If you are below the age
        of 13, you may not use this website.</p>\n\n<h1>Online Privacy Policy Only</h1>\n\n<p>This
        online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our site
        and not to information collected offline.</p>\n\n<h1>Contact</h1>\n\n<p>All
        inquiries and requests (for export, correction, deletion or other things)
        regarding the use of your data on this website should be directed to lorenzd+icosa@gmail.com.</p>\n\n<h1>Your
        Consent</h1>\n\n<p>By using our site, you consent to our web site privacy
        policy and to us using your data in the ways described here.\nChanges to our
        Privacy Policy</p>\n\n<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will
        post those changes on this page.</p>\n\n<p>This document is CC-BY-SA. It was
