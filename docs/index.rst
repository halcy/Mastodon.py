Mastodon.py
===========
.. py:module:: mastodon
    :no-index:
.. py:class: Mastodon

Usage
-----
Register your app! This only needs to be done once (per server, or when distributing rather than hosting an application, most likely per device and server). Uncomment the code and substitute in your information:

.. code-block:: python

    from mastodon import Mastodon

    '''
    Mastodon.create_app(
        'pytooterapp',
        api_base_url = 'https://mastodon.social',
        to_file = 'pytooter_clientcred.secret'
    )
    '''

Then, log in. This can be done every time your application starts, or you can use the persisted information:

.. code-block:: python

    from mastodon import Mastodon

    mastodon = Mastodon(client_id = 'pytooter_clientcred.secret',)
    print(mastodon.auth_request_url())

    # open the URL in the browser and paste the code you get
    mastodon.log_in(
        code=input("Enter the OAuth authorization code: "),
        to_file="pytooter_usercred.secret"
    )


Note that previous versions of Mastodon allowed logging in with username and 
password - unfortunately, due to security concerns, Mastodon has started 
requiring OAuth starting with version 4.4.0. If you're building a bot, you
may with to instead just generate a token in the UI (On Mastodon: 
your-server.com/settings/applications) and use it directly

To post, create an actual API instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from mastodon import Mastodon

    mastodon = Mastodon(access_token = 'pytooter_usercred.secret')
    mastodon.toot('Tooting from Python using #mastodonpy !')

Introduction
------------
`Mastodon`_ is an ActivityPub-based Twitter-like federated social
network node. It has an API that allows you to interact with its
every aspect. This is a simple Python wrapper for that API, provided
as a single Python module.

Mastodon.py aims to implement the complete public Mastodon API. As
of this time, it is feature complete for Mastodon version 4.4.3. The
Mastodon compatible API layers of various other pieces of software as well
as forks, while not an official target, should also be basically
compatible, and Mastodon.py does make some allowances for behaviour that isn't
strictly like that of Mastodon, and attempts to support extensions to the API.

Some usage examples (not neccesarily following app development best practices,
but enough to get you started if you learn best by example) can be found
at https://github.com/halcy/MastodonpyExamples
